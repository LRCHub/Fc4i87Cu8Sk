It's a crazy life, a hazy life
A mixed up, jumbled, phasy life
A crazy life for people who wanna smile
I just don't understand
Why so hard, hard, hard
To say hello before goodbye

It's a coocoo life, a lulu life
A moody magic voodoo life
A coocoo life for people who wanna love

I just don't understand, why so green?
That it's been, hey-ey, hang ups day to day
I gotta pack up, get away

'Cause it's a crazy life
Oh-oh-oh
Yes, it's a crazy life
Crazy life

It's a stupid life, elusive life
A lonely struck, secluded life
A stupid life for people who fly too high

I just don't understand, why so blue?
What to do, oh
I'm gonna kiss my sky goodbye
I'm gonna jump way down and die

'Cause it's a crazy life
Ooh-ho-oh-oh
Yes, it's a crazy life
Crazy life
