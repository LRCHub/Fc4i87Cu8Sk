I went two years lost
So I don't recall
Never did see the light
And if up to you
You know it's true
You probably wouldn't
Be alive

Had the devil
On our shoulder
With a death wish
On our mind
Well the hounds of hell
They knew us well
They were never
Too far behind

We were singing
Someday we'll look back
If we get out alive
It's a crazy life
Someday we'll get out
Of this crazy life

You had long black hair
The devil's stare
Oh you were a mystery
Always come around
To bring me down
Do a little bit for free

You couldn't get
Your shit together
Couldn't bring youself
To right
'Cause it's hard to tell
When you're so unwell
If you're in hell
Or paradise

We were singing
Someday we'll look back
If we get out alive
It's a crazy life
Someday we'll get out
Of this crazy life

Sometimes it's hard to see
When you're sucked down
And reeling
So hard to pull back
In from the tide
It's a crazy life

-Solo-

I went two years lost
So I don't recall
Never did see the light
And if up to you
You know it's true
You probably wouldn't
Be alive

We were singing
Someday we'll look back
If we get out alive
It's a crazy life
Someday we'll get out
Of this crazy life
