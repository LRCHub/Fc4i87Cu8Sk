Shout at the stars
And dance in the fire
Remember what ya told me
It's a crazy life

So when you get tired
Of losin' your mind
Remember what ya told me
It's a crazy life

Yup

Shit got nuts and you can't deny it
Every stick of dynamite we had to light it
Every sticky situation we would find it
And your goddamn right we liked it

We never got bored and we never got tired
We never needed anybody else to try it
We never even knew if we would survive it
But we did and i would rewind it

In case you don't know
Where you go i go
Maybe it's psycho
I don't give a flying

Whoa

Shout at the stars
And dance in the fire
Remember what ya told me
It's a crazy life

So when you get tired
Of losin' your mind
Remember what ya told me
It's a crazy life

Boom

Why go big when we could go bigger
Why go gold when we could go glitter
Why be saints, when we're such good sinners
Why walk - we could run with scissors

Never held a tongue but we held our liquor
Never gave a shit but we gave the finger
Sure we got bit, but we never got bitter
We thought twice but reconsidered

In case you don't know
Where you go i go
Maybe it's psycho
I don't give a flying

Whoa

Shout at the stars
And dance in the fire
Remember what ya told me
It's a crazy life

So when you get tired
Of losin' your mind
Remember what ya told me
It's a crazy life

In case you don't know
I'd walk a tightrope
Maybe i'm psycho
I don't really give a flying fuck

Hahaha

Shout at the stars
And dance in the fire
Remember what ya told me
It's a crazy life

So when you get tired
Of losin' your mind
Remember what ya told me
It's a crazy life
