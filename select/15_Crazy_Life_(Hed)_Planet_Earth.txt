Up in the middle of Tokyo
I hit hydro
Whenever I let my mind go
It's like pshyco, suicidal
Baby love it when I cut it like an animal
(Once again) it's primtime, kamikaze
That policeman tried to rob me
That policeman is afraid of me
But he will never take away my dignity
Someone take this glass away
I'm not myself again
I'm someone else again
Come on, here we go
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
What a crazy life, here we go
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
What a crazy life
Up in the middle of Cali
In an alley
Makin' love to a teenage lady
Ya can't fade me
But don't hate me
She look just like Marsha Brady
I kinda laugh when these girls try to play with me
I told my ex-girlfriend, stay away from me
I got a new girlfriend, and she'll kick your ass
I kinda wonder how long this kind of shit can last
Someone take this glass away
I'm not myself again
I'm someone else again
Come on, here we go
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
What a crazy life, here we go
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
What a crazy life, just bring it
Cra-cra crazy
Cra-cra crazy
Cra-cra crazy
Just bring it
Cra-cra crazy
Cra-cra crazy
Cra-cra crazy
Just bring it
Up in the middle of yo face
What a disgrace
You a trick-ass-bitch
How my dick taste
Motherfucker
No, ain't nobody feelin' you
And I ain't goin' back to prison over killin' you
What?!
I'm the type o' nigga that is build to last
You can fuck me bitch
I put my foot in your ass
Still, I don't givafuck
I just keep fuckin' and smokin'
I'm bruised not broken
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
What a crazy life, here we go
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
Shalala, here it comes again
What a crazy life
Shalala, come on here we go
Shalala, come on here we go
Shalala, come on here we go
What a crazy life
Shalala, come on here we go
Shalala, come on here we go
Shalala, come on here we go
What a crazy life
